# django-chatbot
Welcome to the Django ChatGPT Chatbot repository! This project aims to create a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. The chatbot is integrated into a Django web application, allowing users to interact with it in real-time and get responses based on natural language inputs.
